The dataset contains 1854 digital tyre images, categorized into two classes: defective and good condition. Each image is in a digital format and represents a single tyre. The images are labelled based on their condition, i.e., whether the tyre is defective or in good condition.

I created machine learning model which have 96% test accuracy using data agumntation and CNN model
